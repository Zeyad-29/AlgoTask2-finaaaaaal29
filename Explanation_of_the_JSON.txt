The JSON file contains two main sections:

    Conditions: Lists medical conditions with associated symptoms and their weighted importance. The weights range from 0 to 1, indicating how significant each symptom is for diagnosing the condition. Examples include:
        Cardiovascular Disease: Symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath, and irregular heartbeat, with weights indicating their diagnostic importance.
        Respiratory Disorder, Neurological Condition, Gastrointestinal Disorder, Infection, and two new conditions (Endocrine Disorder, Musculoskeletal Disorder) with their respective symptoms and weights.

    Symptoms: A dictionary that provides a human-readable name for each symptom, linked to its unique key. This section helps users select symptoms in the application.

In summary, this structure enables symptom-based diagnosis by linking medical conditions to specific symptoms and their importance in diagnosing the condition.
